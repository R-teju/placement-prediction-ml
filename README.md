# Placement Prediction System using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a student will be placed or not using Machine Learning algorithms. The prediction is based on student academic and skill-related features.

##  Features

* Predicts student placement using ML
* Compares multiple algorithms:

  * Logistic Regression
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  * Decision Tree
* Selects the best performing model automatically
* Takes real-time user input for prediction

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* VS Code

##  Dataset Features

* CGPA
* Internships
* Projects
* Certifications
* Skills
* Placement Status

##  How it Works

1. Loads dataset from CSV file
2. Splits data into training and testing sets
3. Trains multiple machine learning models
4. Compares model accuracy
5. Selects best model
6. Predicts placement based on user input

## ▶How to Run

```bash
python placement_prediction.py
```

## Example Output

```
Best Model: KNN
Accuracy: 90%

Enter Student Details:
Result: Student will be PLACED
```

## Project Purpose

This project demonstrates practical implementation of machine learning for real-world prediction problems.
